# Overview
This project demonstrates the rendering of a **moving triangle** using vertices and vertex/fragment shaders, implemented with OpenGL libraries. It serves as an example of how graphics are processed through the graphical pipeline and how shaders work to manipulate the rendering process.

The triangle's position and color are dynamically controlled using **uniforms**, which are updated during runtime. By interacting with these uniforms, the object can be moved around the screen, and its color can be changed, demonstrating real-time graphics manipulation.
